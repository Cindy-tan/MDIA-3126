## 3 things I would like to try during this course
- How to organize better my lines of code
- How create a functionable website or webapp
- Im really interested in learning about components that can allow us as coders to provide an accesible way to navigate through the sites
## 2 things I learned tosay
- I learned how to properly use a link tag inside the view tagd, last term we used to do it differently, and it was more simple using only .js and not on .tsx
- Learned a lot when we explored the Expo Docs page. They provide a lot of important lines of code that we depend on to simplify our workflows.
## 1 feeling today
- Tired and sleepy, but always happy
